# Movie API CRUD APP

This is a simple back-end web development project with the aim of learning by doing.
I often focus too much on frontend stuff and I wanted to dive in back-end development using JS/Node.
So searching the web I have found this great tutorial and I coded along and pushed this into my own repo.

Kudos to [dmalvia](https://github.com/dmalvia), creator of the tutorial found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Z02Lgx4nS0) his original repo can be found [here](https://github.com/dmalvia/Vanilla_Nodejs_CRUD_API_Project)

The idea of this project is to create an API of a movies database.
